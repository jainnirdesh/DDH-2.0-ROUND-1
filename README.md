## ❓ Problem Statement
Climate change is accelerating, with **rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and environmental degradation** affecting billions globally. Governments and organizations need **evidence-based policies** to reduce emissions, protect ecosystems, and enhance resilience.  

Using the provided dataset, our analysis explores how factors like **emissions, renewable energy, forest area, and extreme weather events** interact across countries over time. The insights aim to inform **policy interventions** such as promoting renewable energy, conserving forests, and improving climate resilience.

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhadramohit/climate-change-dataset) and includes climate-related metrics:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Year | Year of the data point |
| Country | Country or region |
| Average Temperature (°C) | Average annual temperature |
| CO2 Emissions (Tons/Capita) | Per-person carbon dioxide emissions |
| Sea Level Rise (mm) | Annual sea level increase |
| Rainfall (mm) | Total annual rainfall |
| Population | Total population |
| Renewable Energy (%) | Percentage of energy from renewable sources |
| Extreme Weather Events | Number of storms, floods, etc. |
| Forest Area (%) | Percentage of land covered by forests |

> Note: The dataset may contain inconsistencies such as outliers or missing values, simulating a real-world data challenge.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data structure, quality, and patterns.
- Develop at least **10 targeted EDA questions** (e.g., "How have CO2 emissions trended by country over time?").
- Derive insights to inform **real-world climate policies**.
- Visualize findings using an **interactive dashboard**.
- Present findings to policymakers, emphasizing **actionable recommendations**.

---

## 🧩 EDA Framework
Our structured approach follows a **real-world analytics roadmap**:

1. **Data Understanding**
   - Load and summarize the dataset.
   - Identify anomalies, missing values, and inconsistencies.
   
2. **Data Preparation**
   - Handle duplicates, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - Normalize and aggregate data by country and year.
   
3. **Question Formulation & Exploration**
   - Define 10+ EDA questions across:
     - **Univariate Analysis** – single variable trends.
     - **Bivariate Analysis** – relationships between two variables.
     - **Multivariate Analysis** – interactions among multiple variables.
   - Use **visualizations** like histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, and line charts.
   
4. **Insight Generation**
   - Extract 5–7 key insights linking metrics to policy implications.
   
5. **Policy Recommendations & Presentation**
   - Propose 3–5 actionable policies.
   - Present via a **dashboard or presentation slides**.

---

## 📌 Key Insights (Sample)
- Countries with **higher renewable energy adoption** show slower CO2 emission growth.
- Forest coverage correlates with **reduced extreme weather vulnerability**.
- Sea level rise is accelerating in **coastal regions with higher temperature increases**.
- Policy emphasis on **renewable energy incentives** and **forest conservation** could reduce emissions while promoting resilience.

---

## 💡 Policy Recommendations (Sample)
1. Incentivize **solar and wind energy adoption** in high-emission countries.
2. Implement **afforestation and reforestation programs** to increase forest area.
3. Develop **early-warning systems** for extreme weather events.
4. Support **sustainable urban planning** to mitigate heat islands and flooding risks.
